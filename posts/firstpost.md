## New Blog idea  Reflections with  Plus size women (or ぽっちゃり Pocchari in  Japanese).

Social media does not come with an instruction manual. So I had to create my own.  I consider myself not a thirsty fan. I am a fan who wants to support the entire person. What she is doing is something that takes courage.  Something that I have no clue how they do it. I had a problem trying to write this article. It eventually had to be done.

First off,  I want to thank everyone who takes the time to read my rambling I am not sure if this is going to make much sense but I hope it is the beginning of a series of articles that will lead to something that I would at least appreciate. 

Onto the article……….


I love women in general. All shapes and sizes but I feel betrayed that I did not date any women larger or heavier than me. When I was in High School ( years ago, before the iPhone ) I always tried to fit in I was looking to date a girl and a girl that was not going to get me looks or comments. I was a young scrawny looking guy who didn’t have many options because girls didn’t want to date a guy like me if I looked like a 12-year-old and was 17-18years old. 

It wasn’t until I graduated from college that I had the confidence to do more things that made me uncomfortable. Being comfortable is probably the best place to be in your twenties (I highly recommend anyone to try it.)  For me, I was introduced to a girl who was larger than me and wore bagging clothes. Her vibes at work were more laid back and it is hard to describe in words but I didn’t feel intimidated by her presence and was more interested in talking with her as a person. She got along with everyone.

Her body shape was not huge I would say her measurement were around the bust hip waist was around 39-26-45 inches 5 feet 5 inches but about 240 pounds. Her thighs dwarfed my own easily. Now I was at work and she didn't work in the same group as me but was from time to
Time assign to my team for the reason I'm
Not sure but I was the only one on my team that wasn't married nor in a relationship. I think this made it easy for her to flirt with me.

I always minded my business and played it safe not being the joker of the group. This I realize made it easy for her to tease and flirt with me. On one end it made the other "alpha" like guys on the team more jealous as she resisted their advances and for me feeling more obligated to react.

She was cute, funny and a single mom. I also never dated anyone who had children before so it felt like I couldn't be serious. Apparently thanks to social media I discovered that her older sister knew a good friend of mine and we all decided to hang out one night.  Thinking my friend who knew my co worker’s older sister would show up he left me hanging with me my coworker her sister and her friend all alone after waiting over an hour for my friend.

I was the only guy hanging with them at the moment. At the time I was renting a spot that had a finished basement with a bar and a pool table. This is moment was the first moment I had ever been close to so many women bigger than me at one time. They were very chatty with each other full of life and a little mystery but like any other girl. Except that thanks to my friend not showing up I had more time to think about this situation.  Now thinking back to this situation I see a different situation. 

The imagination of man can get ahead of themselves the possibilities that were available for me or the other I’s within a parallel dimension.  I knew that I could not sleep with all of them (Laugh Out Loud) So if I was going to start dating one I had to be sure it wouldn’t make a mistake and miss out on the best experience.
I started talking with my coworker’s older sister. We were playing pool and the four of us played 2 vs 2
Games.

It was me and I will give my co worker’s older sister a name at this point. Let’s call her Samantha and my co worker’s name will be Kathy that leaves Samantha’s friend name to be Monica. So the first game we played was me and Samantha vs Monica and Kathy (my coworker)

Game 1 Me & Samantha vs Monica and Kathy

In this game, I got the chance to talk much more with Samantha. She was the largest of the three. Her last boyfriend she said was a little taller than I and she could see her taste in men might have rubbed off on her little sister Kathy. I told her we are just friends I told Samantha. She bent over the table to take the opening shot her body hugged the corner pocket of the pool table and made it creak just a little. I spent most of the time watching her and knew that there was something about larger women that enthralled me.

That was a break I said. I barely watched it. Thank she said. Where did you learn to play  I asked. She said I don’t really play I just hang out with a bunch of friends who do. You pick up some stuff. Did you meet your ex playing pool?  I asked She snapback with a laugh Why are you so interested in who my ex was? I told her quickly it just has me curious that’s all. 

Kathy chimed in and said she was still in love with that cocksucker. I am not said, Samantha. Monica shouted from the other side of the table it’s my turn we got stripes. Monica was more bottom-heavy of the three she had about C cup breasts but through her shirt, it was hard to tell she was wearing black jeans and she had this weird waddle like a penguin that I noticed she needed to wiggle in order to move around.  

I was not drunk but I was intrigued bigger girls to me was becoming a whole new thing. I know you may think oh you’re just a guy with a dirty mind who probably just follows plus size girls on Instagram because you want to sleep with them.  You are right I do want to sleep with them all three of them. That is unlikely though. 
There was energy in this room the type that I normally have not felt. Flirting with each reciprocated a primal 
Level of eros that I have never felt before. 

No, I did not want to just sleep with them but wonder how did I live my life for so long and never sense such energy. When I started college I was very shy and immature I stuck with what felt right for the group it suffices for the time being but eventually, it always felt that there was more that I should explore. Girls I talked to my first year in college girls talked very much like a script from a college teen movie. 

In this room, though I started to think that my friend never decided to come and the three of them was up to something. Something….forbidden.

bro shows up my co worker's sister and a friend decided to leave since they could see that we might want to be alone at least that's how I thought it went down.  Each giving me a great big hug and realizing how soft their bodies were they didn't pretend at all the feeling wasn't there
